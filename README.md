I used ai to generate the code for the shapes and model script. It generated essentially what I wanted but a main issue I have found with ai is that it is hard to integrate locally and integrate your own files for some reason. I'm researching now as to why because its as if the code can't see your local files some times which I find odd. But in terms of everything else it made it was very easy to read and modify.
